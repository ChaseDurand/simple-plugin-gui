# simple-plugin-gui

Development status: in progress.

A simple audio plugin made with JUCE showing knobs, toggles, switches, and a VU meter.

This plugin includes my subjective and non-exhaustive list of details that make a plugin feel high quality and easy to use, including:
* Proportional resizing
* Double click controls to reset
* Arrow keys to adjust values
* Shift/control while modifying for fine adjustment
* Parameters exposed to host DAW for automation with accurate labels and values
* GUI feedback on mouse hover and select
* Parameter smoothing to prevent pops/clicks
